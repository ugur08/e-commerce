In this Angular project I developed as an e-commerce system, I used CSS-Bootstrap, NgRx and Json API. The first main page appears, non-members cannot perform the shopping cart process, members are directly in the user position, in order to be able to change the membership status to admin position, it is necessary to change the membership status from the management panel. My application is still in progress.
